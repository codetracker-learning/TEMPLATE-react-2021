# React Template
This template includes all the dependencies and set up needed for you to work within defined code standards and structure to get you up and running quickly.

If you are interested in setting up your own project for things outside of class, you can run the command to start a React project `npx create-react-app {APP_NAME}` and setup all the files and structures from scratch.
## Get Started
```bash
$ npx husky install
$ npm install
```
